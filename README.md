# AWS-Terraform-VPN-virtual-private-gateway

This GitHub repository contains a Terraform script that sets up a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) on AWS. A VGW allows communication between an AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and on-premises networks using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection. The script can be used to automate the creation and configuration of the VGW and the necessary components such as VPN connections, customer gateways, and routing.
